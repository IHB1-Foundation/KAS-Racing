# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Preferred: use GitHub Security Advisories / Private Vulnerability Reporting (if enabled for this repo).

If that is not available, email: **security@example.com** (replace with your preferred address).

## Secrets
- Never commit private keys, seeds, mnemonics, or API keys.
- Do not commit `.env` files; use `.env.example` when needed.
